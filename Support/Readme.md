# Support Application

The Support application is a utility tool designed to interact with the ChipLogic application. It uses the same `config.xml` file from ChipLogic to connect to the database and allows for adding users via command line.

## Features

- Add a new user with a username and password using command-line arguments.
- Utilizes the existing `config.xml` from the ChipLogic application for database connection details.

## Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0
- ChipLogic application with a configured `config.xml`

## Configuration

The Support application relies on the `config.xml` file generated by the ChipLogic application for database connection settings. Ensure that the ChipLogic application has been set up and that the `config.xml` file exists in the same directory as `Support.exe`.

## Usage

### Add a User

To add a new user, run the `Support.exe` with the `-u` and `-p` options to specify the username and password, respectively.

#### Syntax
Support.exe -u <username> -p <password>
